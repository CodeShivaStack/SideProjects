⭐ Indian-Localized Testimonials for Your Landing Page
Dr. Ananya Rao

Orthopedic Surgeon, Manipal Hospitals, Bengaluru

“PEMF-based EMTT has significantly improved our approach to stubborn fractures and delayed healing cases. The cellular-level regeneration we see with patients using Pulse IX is impressive — recovery timelines are noticeably shorter compared to standard modalities.”

Prof. Raghav Subramanian

Wellness Researcher & Author, Chennai

“PEMF therapy is like giving your body a natural recharge — almost like topping up a battery. It supports cellular energy, which is vital for healing, recovery and overall wellbeing. What I appreciate most is how easily the routine fits into daily Indian lifestyles.”

Lata Krishnamurthy

Pulse IX User, Bengaluru

“My experience with Pulse IX has been wonderful. It reduced my chronic shoulder and back pain, improved my energy levels, and helped me stay more connected to my body’s needs. I feel lighter, more active, and far more comfortable in daily movement.”
